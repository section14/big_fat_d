The following is a list of the IC's I used in this project. They all use the Serial data communication method with the Arduino. There are many varieties of the following IC's available. You don't have to use these exact chips in your project. This list is simmply to guide you in purchasing IC's for your project.

LED's, Pots, jacks, etc. won't be listed. I used 500k alpha's for all the pots, but you find something else works better. All the switches are plain old two way switches and the step length selector is a 3-way rotory switch.

Chips used:

Multiplexer - NXP 8-channel analog multiplexer/demultiplexer
Part# HEF4051B

Shift Register - ON 8 bit shift register
Part# MC74HC595A

DAC - Microchip Digital to Analog Converter
Part# MCP4921
